# Car-Price-Prediction


This project focuses on predicting the price of used cars using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, visualization, and training a regression model to estimate the price based on car features.

# Overview
The notebook performs the following key tasks:

* Loads and explores the dataset (cardekho.csv)

* Handles missing values

* Converts categorical features to numerical format

* Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA)

* Trains regression models to predict car prices

# Dataset
The dataset contains various attributes of used cars such as:

* Car Name

* Year

* Selling Price

* Present Price

* Kms Driven

* Fuel Type

* Seller Type

* Transmission

* Owner

# Techniques Used
* Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation

* Seaborn & Matplotlib for data visualization

* Label Encoding for handling categorical data

* Regression models (like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)

* Model Evaluation Metrics (RÂ² score, MAE, etc.)

# Results
The final model was evaluated using appropriate metrics to check its performance on test data. The model was able to predict car prices with good accuracy, depending on the chosen algorithm and preprocessing steps.
